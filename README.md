## THINGS TO NOTE

- This is not optimised for mobile. The public facing surveys themselves are responsive, but any dashboard pages are not. Use desktop for survey creation/management.
- Things are slow and clunky. Perf improvements down the line.
- There are no tests.
- There's only 16 colours in the chart customisation palette.
- Need a kanban board for feature tracking.
- Db and serverless calls can be optimised when fetching data
- DB schema currently uses a jsonb column for questions and responses. This may need refactoring in the future.
- SURVEYS CANNOT BE EDITED ONCE PUBLISHED.
